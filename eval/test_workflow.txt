test_workflow 

workflow to check out buggy and fixed versions of a given defects4j bug, then run an evosuite test suite on both the buggy and fixed versions 


below example is for Math 1

** note: assumes you have downloaded tar files of evosuite test suites into the director original_tars, like this: 

<myfolder>/
	original_tars/
		Math-1b-evosuite.100.tar.bz2
	checked_out/
		buggy/
		fixed/	 


** note: if you're doing this inside a git repo, checkout your bugs (step 1) outside the repo or .gitignore checked_out/, otherwise you have to deal with nested git repos 



1. check out bugs, both buggy and fixed 

	$ defects4j checkout -p Math -v 1b -w checked_out/buggy/math1 

	$ defects4j checkout -p Math -v 1f -w checked_out/fixed/math1 



2. try running editas2's evosuite test suites on the checked out bugs, just to make sure defects4j is working 

	$ defects4j test -w checked_out/buggy/math1 -s original_tars/Math-1b-evosuite.100.tar.bz2

	$ defects4j test -w checked_out/fixed/math1 -s original_tars/Math-1b-evosuite.100.tar.bz2 

**note: expected behavior: should fail 0 tests on the fixed version. probably won't fail any tests on the buggy version either, unless by some miracle evosuite happened to catch a bug 




3. untar / uncompress your evosuite test suites and move them to a new folder 

	$ cd original_tars
	$ tar xjvf Math-1b-evosuite.100.tar.bz2
	$ mkdir ../math1_evotests
	$ mv org/ ../math1_evotests
	$ cd ..


4. make changes 

i.e. modify assertions within the evosuite test suites
for this bug, found in math1_evotests/


5. tar and bzip2 the evosuite tests so they can be used to test 

	
	$ cd math1_evotests/
	$ tar cvjf math1b.2.tar.bz2 .



6. try running on both buggy and fixed versions  
 

	$ defects4j test -w checked_out/buggy/math1 -s math1.tar.bz2
